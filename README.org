Xah Lee's emacs init files.

This is not good for public use, because they are only for my own workflow, and change randomly every week.

Try the following instead:
List of Emacs Starter Kits
http://ergoemacs.org/misc/list_of_emacs_starter_kits.html

Tricks in my init has a corresponding page at

 Xah Emacs Tutorial http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html

 Xah Emacs Lisp Tutorial http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp.html

Use the search box there.
