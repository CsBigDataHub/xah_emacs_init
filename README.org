Xah Lee's emacs init files.

This is not good for public use, because they are only for my own workflow, and change randomly every week.

For public, i recommend http://ergoemacs.github.io/ergoemacs-mode/

Tricks in my init has a corresponding page at

* Xah Emacs Tutorial http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html
* Xah Emacs Lisp Tutorial http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp.html
