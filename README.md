Xah Lee's emacs init files. They run on top of http://code.google.com/p/ergoemacs/source/checkout

this is my personal init. Not good for public use, because they very much are only for my own workflow, and are heavily experimental, and changes every few days.

most function/tricks in my init has a corresponding page at

* Xah Emacs Tutorial http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/emacs.html
* Xah Emacs Lisp Tutorial http://ergoemacs.org/emacs/elisp.html

use the search box there.
